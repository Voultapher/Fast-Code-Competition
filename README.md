# Fast Code Competition

### Abstract:
Many embrace the challenge that is c++, for the manual control it offers.  
Often this desire for control is rooted in a need of efficient applications.  
With modern c++ we are promised the performance of bare metal c,  
with concise syntax and a compile time safety providing type system.  
Increasing hardware complexity and the rise of accelerators, make writing  
truly optimal code an ever more elusive goal.

How far from optimal are we usually and how does it compare to other languages?  
Join us and show us your skill in writing fast and elegant software.  
Every programming language is welcome.
